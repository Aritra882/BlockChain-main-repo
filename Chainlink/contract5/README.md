⛓️ Chainlink LogTrigger Counter Upkeep Overview
This repository documents a Chainlink LogTrigger Upkeep, a type of Chainlink Automation that reliably executes a smart contract function in response to a specific on-chain event (log) being emitted by another contract.

The purpose of this setup is to increment a counter on a designated smart contract every time a specific event is logged by a separate contract, demonstrating the power of event-driven automation in Web3.
