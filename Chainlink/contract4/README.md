⏱️ CustomLogic — Chainlink Automation Smart Contract

A lightweight, gas-efficient smart contract designed to demonstrate Chainlink Automation (Keepers) using a simple time-based counter update.
The contract autonomously increments a counter after a fixed interval, showcasing how decentralized automation removes the need for manual triggering.

📝 Overview

CustomLogic uses Chainlink Automation to:

*Continuously check if a predefined time interval has passed

*Automatically execute state-changing logic (counter++) when the condition is met

*Operate without any manual intervention once deployed

This contract is ideal for learning or integrating periodic tasks such as:

*Scheduled updates

*Oracle-based logic

*Automated reward distribution

*Counter increments / maintenance logic

*Time-triggered state resets

✨ Features

✔ Fully compatible with Chainlink Automation

✔ Immutable interval for gas optimization

✔ Time-based automation using block timestamps

✔ Simple, modular logic that can be extended

✔ Low-cost and secure
